## 🌐 Network Visualization

This project features a powerful network visualization tool that helps users understand social dynamics within digital environments. 

- **Nodes** 🌟: Each circle represents a user in the network.
- **Edges** 🔗: The lines connecting these circles illustrate the relationships or connections between users.
  
### 💡 Additional Insights
- **Color and Size** 🎨: The color and size of the nodes convey crucial information, such as the node degree (the number of direct connections a user has) within the network.
- **Dynamic Layout** 📐: The layout is dynamically generated, providing a clear and intuitive view of connections, allowing for exploration of the social graph.

**The image below show an interactive visualization of a social media network.**

## ⭐ Features

- **Add Users**: Easily add new users to the network.
- **Add connections**: Add connections between users.
- **Manage Connections**: Create and remove connections (friendships) between users.
- **Display Graph**: View the current state of the social network as an adjacency matrix.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Implement common graph algorithms such as DFS and BFS.
- **Visualization**: Generate visual representations of the social network graph.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Python** (High-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability)
- **Tkinter** (For GUI)
- **NetworkX** (For graph manipulation)
- **Colorama** (For colored terminal output)
- **Matplotlib** (For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations)

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/social-media-network-analysis.git
   cd social-media-network-analysis

2. Install the required packages:
   
     . import tkinter as tk  
        For creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python.
     . from tkinter import messagebox, simpledialog, ttk
        messagebox: for displaying message boxes.
        simpledialog: for prompting the user to enter simple data.
        ttk: for using widgets.
     . import os
     . import networkx as nx   
        For the creation, manipulation, and study of complex networks.
     . import matplotlib.pyplot as plt   
        For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
     . from colorama import Fore, Style, init   
        For format text output in the console with colors.
     . import os  
        For interacting with the operating system, such as clearing the console screen.
     . import heapq   
        For the priority queue implementation.
